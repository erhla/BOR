## TIF Districts

Tax increment financing (TIF) is a "special funding tool...used to promote public and private investment" in specific areas. TIFs are funded by capturing future property value increases through freezing property values for 23 or 35 years. 

In practice, TIFs have strange impacts on the property tax system. For example, any appeals or exemptions granted to properties in a TIF which is above its initial frozen value have no impact on tax rates and **only** reduce the amount of revenue that a TIF collects. This analysis attempts to quantify the impacts of TIFs by presenting alternate (counterfactual) tax bills as if they did not exist.
